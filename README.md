# Weather API

## Description

This is a weather dashboard where the user can search for a city and be provided with a report of weather data. They will receive the forecast for the current weather conditions and a 5-day forecast representing future weather conditions. Their searched city will be added to their search history list. If the user needs to toggle back to a previously searched city, they can click the city from their search history to re-display that data.
